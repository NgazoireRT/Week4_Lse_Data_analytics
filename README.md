# Week4_Lse_Data_analytics

Data visualisation transforms data to communicate answers, provide strategic insights, and inform tactical, operational, and business outcomes. We'll look at transforming tabular data into effective visualisations to answer significant business questions more than simply plotting some variables on an x-axis and a y-axis (although this can be helpful too!). 

Visualising data has multiple uses. It can help to highlight cybersecurity patterns, manage workplace efficiency for global companies, and even inform public policy to fight climate change. The key question is: What impact do you want your visualisations to have?

In this module, we’ll explore the Python visualisation packages Matplotlib and Seaborn. Seaborn is built on Matplotlib, and we’ll examine the capabilities, benefits, and limitations of each of the two packages.

Seaborn has many functions, which we’ll gradually be introduced to in this module – particularly some of the most useful functions. These functions will build a good foundation for performing more advanced visualisations in the future. We’ll also continue using Jupyter Notebook and your GitHub repository throughout the module

Learning outcomes
Throughout the module, you’ll learn to:

use Python plotting library to create a visualisation workflow
create and improve visualisations in Python, leveraging design principles to identify and communicate insights
customise plots using Seaborn and Matplotlib, including using custom colours, markers, and styles
export visualisations to file formats that can be shared.
